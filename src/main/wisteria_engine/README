- TODO:
    - [ ] Instead of writing different shaders for different rendering modes,
          write a single shader using preprocessor directives and load the shader
          multiple times, prepending the appropriate directives to the shader source.
    - [ ] Add a virtual `void Update()` method to the `GameObject` class to allow
          for updating the game object's state in derived classes. This will effectively
          allow implementing Components like in Unity, just that a component will be
          just a child game object of the game object it is attached to, instanced from a
          derived class of `GameObject`.
